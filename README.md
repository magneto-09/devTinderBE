## For Development - Branching & PR Workflow
* **NAMING CONVENTION**
  * For **features**:
    * Use the `feature-` prefix.
    * Example: feature-login, feature-user-auth
  * For **bug fixes**:
    * Use the `hotfix-` prefix.
    * Example: hotfix-crash-on-submit, hotfix-ui-glitch
* Check out that remote branch locally.
* Create a local child branch from the remote branch to make your changes.
* Raise a PR from the local child branch to the remote parent branch (base).
* Once the PR is approved, it can be merged â€” direct pushes are not allowed due to branch protection rules.
