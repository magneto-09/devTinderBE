## For Development - Branching & PR Workflow
* Always start by creating a new branch from GitHub (this creates a remote branch).
* Check out that remote branch locally.
* Create a local child branch from the remote branch to make your changes.
* Raise a PR from the local child branch to the remote parent branch (base).
* Once the PR is approved, it can be merged â€” direct pushes are not allowed due to branch protection rules.
